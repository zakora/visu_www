Visualization challenge: Impact of the WWW
=================


## What is it?
Our current work on the visualizing.org challenge: *Impact of the WWW*.

## How is it made?
The visualization itself is built with d3.js, so we use HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## How is it organized?
The visualization is in the root directory. All the data we use (and more) are in the `data` directory.
